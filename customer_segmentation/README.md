## Method
- Data prep and feature scaling
- Elbow method to choose k
- Silhouette score to validate cluster quality
- K-Means clustering and 2D visualization
- Irrelevant columns (CustomerID) and categorical variables (Genre) were excluded. The clustering was performed on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
## Outputs
